## Site overview & audience
The website is my personal portfolio.  
I present myself, including my passions about AI and mathematics, my academic achievements, and some personal projects I have built.  

The intended audience is instructors, peers, and potential collaborators who want to quickly learn who I am, see my work, and find ways to contact me.

## Site map
- **Home (`index.html`)** — one-sentence theme, navigation provided.  
- **About (`about.html`)** — profile portrait, short bio, skills and education.  
- **Projects (`projects.html`)** — project cards with descriptions, tags, and screenshots.  
- **Header & Footer** — present on all pages for consistent navigation and contact info.

## Design notes
- **Typography:** I used serif (merriwheather) for headings + sans-serit (inter) for body text. 
- **Navigation:** A consistent header/footer is present across all pages.
- **Visuals:** The portrait photo adds personality in the website, while the screenshots are used to illustrate the projects.  
- **Aesthetic:** In order to demonstrate an approachable style, I used rounded corners, whitespace, and subtle shadows.
